# Dice-Game
I made a simple Dice Game App. Main goal of this simple project is DOM Manipulation with Function Programming. Gived arguments are based on standard value min: 1 and max: 6. Entire function creates random numbers between 1 - 6 using Math.random function with formula which can not create number 0 using its arguments min and max. I avoid to use innerHTML because of its security risks. You can also see that I used ECMAScript 6(ES2015) features such as let/const variables and template literals. To play this game, you can just press on "Play" button.
